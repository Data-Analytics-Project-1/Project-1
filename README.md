# Project-1  
Group project exploring the relationships between food insecurity, access to healthcare, and ethnicity in CA using county data sourced from the internet.
Correlation analyses were run between metrics of food insecurity and access to healthcare with no correlation found. Ethnic distribution data was parsed as follows: white, non-white, largest 2 ethnic groups (hispanic, asian), and smallest 4 ethnic groups (black, american indian, multi-racial, hawaiian/pacific islander). Each group was analyzed with regard to food insecurity and access to healthcare, with no correlations found. Conclusion is that there is no disparity between ethnic groups in CA with regard to these metrics, which indicates a lack of discrimination and is determined to be a good thing.
